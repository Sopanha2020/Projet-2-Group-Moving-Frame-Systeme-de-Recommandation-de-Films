The film concerns a couple visiting Vermont in order to be married, and interviewing local residents on the subject of marriage. Largely improvised and using non-professional actors, the film was shown at various film festivals including the Melbourne International Film Festival and the Hawaii International Film Festival. The movie was not very well-received by the national press, with the New York Times calling it, “vaguely amiable.” While the Washington Post review commented that the film was an “all-too-easy target for ridicule,” it also mentioned one of the film’s high points: “In one scene, a typically droll Vermont resident (playing himself) sums up his state’s fabled coolness to strangers by suggesting that a sign be placed at the state line, reading ‘Welcome to Vermont. Now Leave.’”",0.6,/dBiufr6Xow23YvQjSRGgd0xAvu5.jpg,1993-03-26,0,88,['en'],Released,Vermont Is for Lovers,6.5,4,['Zeitgeist Films'],"George Thrush, Marya Cohn",John O'Brien,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/dBiufr6Xow23YvQjSRGgd0xAvu5.jpg
